spelling bee
============

[![Build](https://github.com/bakerkretzmar/spelling-bee/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bakerkretzmar/spelling-bee/actions)

A word game based on [**Spelling Bee**](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) from _The New York Times_ crossword—and when I say “based on,” I mean it’s an exact copy of that game. I built it as a learning exercise, please don’t sue me.
